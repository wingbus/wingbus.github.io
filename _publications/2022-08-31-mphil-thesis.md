Robot-assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) and Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) are commonly adopted in Gastro-Intestinal (GI) surgeries such as Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD). While using fully flexible cable-driven robots brings benefits to patients such as lower rate of complications and shorter healing time, the engineering challenges, for example, size and stiffness, manufacturability, and sensorless environment, limit functionalities of robotic instruments and surgical performance. The rolling feature, rotation along the wrist of the instrument, is a good-to-have feature for surgical procedures with orientational and positional requirements such as grasping, tractioning, and suturing. In traditional laparoscopy, rolling can be achieved by rotating the long straight rod of the instruments, which is straightforward and effective. However, this is not commonly found in cable-driven endoscopic robotic systems due to mechanical limits for linear-to-rolling motion conversion at the distal end and unmodelled non-linear friction resisting torque transmission from the proximal end.

In this work, a miniaturizable distal joint rotation mechanism for endoscopic instruments and robotic manipulators to improve dexterity and manipulability is proposed. The design of this distal joint rotation mechanism is based on the inverse of the barrel cam mechanism, in which a pair of push-pull wires with two rollers attached turns the circular cam by an out-of-phase linear oscillation. The kinematic and dynamic models, and the experiment for proving the validity of this mechanism are presented. The performance and the characteristics of the rotational joint prototype are also evaluated.

After a preliminary experiment and study, a set of experiments is performed to compare this mechanism and the bevel gear mechanism. Experimental results show that the proposed mechanism is able to generate a higher torque, an unlimited number of revolutions with position tracking, and is non-backdrivable, which is more advanced than the bevel gear mechanism and other existing distal joint rotation mechanisms.

The experiment is extended to the tendon-sheath mechanism. A position-current controller that can adapt to different environments without the need for distal or overtube shape sensors is developed. Experimental results show that the controller can overcome backlash, non-linear friction, and hysteresis, and control the rotation of the mechanism successfully. The position tracking performance of the proposed mechanism excels from that of torque coil transmission.
