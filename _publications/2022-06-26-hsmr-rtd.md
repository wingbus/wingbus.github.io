Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) for the removal of large lesions en-bloc is an emerging endoscopic technique. However, the often blocked surgical view by dissected mucosa prolongs the time for operation, steepens the learning curve, and increases the risk of complications. Traction assisting methods are used widely to increase exposure to the submucosal surgical field. Cost-effective methods such as magnetic anchor and clip-and-string offer effective independent retraction but limiting to uni-direction. Secondary hand methods, including the use of external forceps, double- balloon, and robotic-assisted systems, are more dexterous in tissue manipulation but suffer from coupling lifter and dissector motion. Recent bimanual endoscopic robots prompt to provide an optimal solution but the long development time and large investment involved hinder the ready applicability of these complex systems. In this work, we aim to explore a portable robotic platform that provides dexterous tissue manipulation to comprehend the dynamics in ESD, as an alternate and reference to the more advanced robotic platform.
