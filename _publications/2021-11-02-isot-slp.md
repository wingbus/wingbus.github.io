Three-dimensional imaging plays an important role in surgery. 3D geometry information is conducive to safer and more efficient surgery. In this paper, we present a novel structured light 3D imaging system that is specifically designed to overcome critical shortcomings over many 3D endoscopic and laparoscopic surgical systems. The novel system embeds a design utilizing a single channel to conduct both optical information transmission and reception. With the bi-directional configuration, two 3D data at different optical angles are constructed. The two 3D data sets can then be consolidated into a wholistic 3D scan, revealing more data than current structured light systems.
