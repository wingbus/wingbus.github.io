## Objectives

* To design and manufacture 3 soccer robots to compete with contestants from USA, India and South America in the ASME Student Design Competiton
* To build tennis ball shooting mechanisms on top of robot chassis

## Methods

1. Brainstorm multiple designs, iterate and prototype quickly

    In order to decide which type of drivetrain and shooting mechanism best suit the game's nature and our team's strategy, we looped through robot development cycle multiple times.

2. Finalise our design and robots

    After experimenting with various drivetrains (e.g. differential drive, tank drive, mecanum drive) and shooting mechanisms (e.g. spring-loaded rack and pinion, flywheel). We decided to use differential drive, tank drive and flywheel due to their simplicity, robustness and power. By reversing rotation, the flywheel can even grap and hold tennis balls securely.

3. Practice makes perfect

    We spent a lot of time practising to get familiar with the control of the robots and build a sense of offense, defense and cooperation in the game field.

## Results

1. Awarded second place

    By securing the last goal in the last 10 seconds, our team won second place.
