## Objectives

* To design and manufacture 3 soccer robots to compete with contestants from USA, India and South America
* To build tennis ball shooting mechanisms on top of robot chassis

## Methods

1. Brainstorm multiple designs, iterate and prototype quickly

    In order to decide which type of drivetrain and shooting mechanism best suit the game's nature and our team's strategy, we loop through robot development cycle multiple time.

2. Finalise our design and robots

    After experiementing with various drivetrains (e.g differential drive, tank drive, mecanum drive) and shooting mechanisms (e.g. spring-loaded rack and pinion, flywheel). We decided to use differential drive, tank drive and fly wheel due to their simplicity, robustness and power. The flywheel can even grap and hold tennis ball easily.

3. Practice makes perfect

    We spent a lot of time practising to get familiar with the control of the robots and build sense of offense, defense and cooperation in game field.
